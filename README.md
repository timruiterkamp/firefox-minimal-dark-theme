_Navigation and menu icons appear when hovering over the nav- or toolbar_

## Setup

##### Expert
Choose your preferred verison of the theme and add its userChrome.css file to the chrome folder in firefox's root directory.

##### Beginner
- Type `about:profiles` into your url bar and press enter.
- Press the button next to the path of your Root Directory. This should open it in your default file manager.
- Locate the chrome folder (create one if it does not exist) and add the userChrome.css file of your preferred version.
- The theme should be enabled after restarting the browser. 

### Customization
The easiest way to make your own changes to this theme is to enable firefox's live editing mode.

- Press `cmd + shift + i` or `ctrl + shift + i` to open the toolbox 
- Click on the three dots on the right (in the top bar) and click settings or press F1.
- Scroll down to `Advanced settings` and enable the following:
    `Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes`
    `Enable remote debugging`
- Now you can customize the theme live from the browser by hitting `cmd + alt + shit + i` or `ctrl + alt + shift + i`.
- Go to the Style Editor tab and open the userChrome.css file and start editing.
- The inspector works like normal and you can pick elements in the UI as you would on a webpage.
