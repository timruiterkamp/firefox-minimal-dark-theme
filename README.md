Minimal dark theme for firefox

![The theme](https://github.com/timruiterkamp/firefox-minimal-dark-theme/blob/master/firefox-browser.png)
_On hover the icons of navigation and options appear_

## Setup

The first steps are going into the firefox browser and typing: `about:profiles` in the url bar. This will take you to an overview of your profiles.
Here you select the root directory and open it in your filesystem (open in finder for example).

### Next steps

- Create a map named `chrome`.
- Drop the file named `userChrome.css` from this repository inside the chrome map.
- Restart your browser and enjoy

### Customization

- You can customize the file live from the browser when hitting `cmd + alt + shit + i` or on windows: `ctrl + alt + shift + i`.
- Go to the style editor and search for the userChrome.css file and start editing.
- The inspector works like normal and you can just lookup every element on the page.
